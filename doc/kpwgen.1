.SH DESCRIPTION
Kpwgen is a word-based password generator. It produces passwords
following the XKCD password scheme (https://xkcd.com/936/). Passwords
are generated by choosing random words from your system word list and
randomness is taken from the system's random number generator.

By default only the generated password is printed, but further
information can be produced by specifying the verbose (\fB\-v\fR) flag.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-entropy\fR=\fIENTROPY\fR
Requests a password with the specified minimum amount of entropy. The
entropy value may be specified as an integer or a decimal number and
is measured in bits. This option supersedes the value of
\fB\-\-words\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-expand=\fR=\fIEXPAND\fR
Specifies the probability of applying a character substitution. This
value must be a decimal value between \fI0.0\fR and \fI1.0\fR. A value
of \fI0.0\fR disables the character substitutions. The default value
is \fI0.25\fR.

Several commonly-used character substitutions are currently
possible. For example, the letter 'a' may be replaced with an at
sign '@'. Each eligible character is marked for replacement with
probability \fIEXPAND\fR. For each marked character, one of the
possible substitutions is then chosen uniformly at random.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints a help message with a brief description of available options.

.TP
\fB\-\-maxlen\fR=\fIMAX\fR
Sets the maximum length of eligible words drawn from the
dictionary. The value must be an integer length. The default value is
\fI8\fR. Words longer than this length will not appear in the
generated password.

.TP
\fB\-\-minlen\fR=\fIMIN\fR
Sets the minimum length of eligible words drawn from the
dictionary. The value must be an integer length. The default value is
\fI4\fR. Words shorter than this length will not appear in the
generated password.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Prints additional information about the generated password. By default
only the password with character replacements is printed. Verbose mode
prints the entropy of the generated password, the words chosen before
character replacements (to aid memorization), the password after
character replacements, and a visual indicator of which characters
were replaced.

.TP
\fB\-\-words\fR=\fIWORDS\fR
Requests a password containing the specified number of words. The
number of words must be an integer. The default value is \fI4\fR.
